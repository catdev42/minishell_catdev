command+D should also signal end of file and bring a new line


expander not tested - have to put into expand.c and update minishell.h
i like the idea of just parser.h. which will host the lexer, parser and expander!

i decided to expand before fully parsing 
because this somehow made sence with making 2D array out of the command...
and being able to tell whether to expand the variable seeing as 
the outside quotes are lost in the parser
